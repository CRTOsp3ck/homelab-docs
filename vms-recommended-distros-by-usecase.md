Great question.

While **Debian/Ubuntu** are the default and easiest for Jenkins, you can absolutely use **CentOS**, **Red Hat**, or even **Arch Linux**, but each comes with trade-offs, especially when it comes to **LXC containers** in Proxmox.

---

## üß± OPTION 1: CentOS / Red Hat-based LXC Containers

> TL;DR: **Avoid CentOS/RHEL in LXC if possible**, unless you really need it. Use a VM instead.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CentOS in LXC ‚Äì Potential Problems

* CentOS/RHEL is not LXC-friendly out of the box.
* Systemd may not behave properly inside unprivileged LXCs.
* Docker often has issues inside RHEL-based LXC (requires nesting and special tweaks).
* Fewer prebuilt templates available in Proxmox (`pveam` doesn‚Äôt list CentOS templates anymore as of newer Proxmox versions).

### ‚úÖ If you still want to try:

1. **Use a privileged container**

   * Uncheck ‚ÄúUnprivileged Container‚Äù when creating it.
2. **Enable nesting**

   ```bash
   pct set 900 -features nesting=1
   ```
3. **Use a CentOS 7/8 image manually:**

   * Download from [Linux Containers Images](https://uk.lxd.images.canonical.com/images/centos/)
   * Import into Proxmox:

     ```bash
     wget https://uk.lxd.images.canonical.com/images/centos/7/amd64/default/20230610_07:08/rootfs.tar.xz
     tar -I 'xz' -cf centos-7.tar.gz rootfs.tar.xz
     pveam add local centos-7.tar.gz
     ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Still, **a VM is the recommended way to run CentOS or RHEL-based systems for Jenkins**.

## üíª OPTION 2: VMs ‚Äì Recommended Distros by Use Case

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of distros you can safely run Jenkins on **in a VM**, and when to use them:

| Distro                              | Use Case                             | Pros                                                            | Cons                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Ubuntu Server (22.04/24.04 LTS)** | Default choice                       | Stable, huge community, Jenkins + Docker support out-of-the-box | None                                        |
| **Debian (12 Bookworm)**            | Stability-focused setups             | Lightweight, stable, ideal for production                       | Slightly slower package updates             |
| **CentOS Stream 9**                 | RHEL compatibility                   | RHEL-compatible, upstream of RHEL                               | Less stable than RHEL, LXC issues           |
| **Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux**         | Free RHEL clones                     | 1:1 RHEL downstream, long support cycle                         | Slower adoption of bleeding-edge features   |
| **Arch Linux**                      | Bleeding-edge builds, CI experiments | Latest packages, great for dev/test                             | Not stable for long-term production Jenkins |
| **Fedora Server**                   | Developer environments               | Modern systemd, SELinux enabled                                 | Shorter support lifecycle (\~13 months)     |
| **openSUSE Leap / Tumbleweed**      | Unique ecosystem                     | YaST, Zypper, good enterprise support                           | Less Jenkins ecosystem documentation        |

## üéØ Recommendations Summary

| Setup                    | Recommendation                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LXC Container**        | Stick to Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 for best support                 |
| **VM (Jenkins Server)**  | Use Ubuntu, Debian, Rocky Linux, or AlmaLinux                      |
| **Arch/Fedora/openSUSE** | Only for dev environments or if you're familiar with the ecosystem |
| **CentOS in LXC**        | Not recommended unless you're doing it for learning purposes only  |

## üîß Pro Tips

* For **Jenkins with Docker builds**, pick a distro with stable Docker support (Ubuntu/Rocky).
* If you're using **Jenkins agents/nodes**, it's okay to use Arch or Fedora as agents if you want bleeding-edge tooling.
* **If you're using Ansible**, Ubuntu/Debian or RHEL-based systems are well-supported for automation.

Let me know:

* Would you like a Jenkins setup guide specifically for **Rocky Linux / RHEL**?
* Or are you looking for a hardened Jenkins setup with **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** support?

I can also generate the `cloud-init` or VM templates for specific distros if needed.
