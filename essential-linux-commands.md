```

### Kill processes
```bash
# Kill by process ID
kill 1234
kill -9 1234        # Force kill

# Kill by process name
killall firefox
pkill -f "process_name"

# Kill all processes by user
pkill -u username
```

## üìÅ File & Directory Operations

### Navigation
```bash
pwd                 # Print working directory
ls                  # List files
ls -la              # List with details and hidden files
ls -lh              # List with human-readable sizes
cd /path/to/dir     # Change directory
cd ..               # Go up one directory
cd ~                # Go to home directory
cd -                # Go to previous directory
```

### File Operations
```bash

touch file.txt      # Create empty file
mkdir dirname       # Create directory
mkdir -p path/to/dir # Create nested directories

# Copy & Move
cp file1 file2      # Copy file
cp -r dir1 dir2     # Copy directory recursively
mv file1 file2      # Move/rename file
mv file1 /path/     # Move to directory

# Delete
rm file.txt         # Delete file
rm -r dirname       # Delete directory recursively
rm -rf dirname      # Force delete directory
rmdir dirname       # Delete empty directory
```

### File Viewing
```bash
cat file.txt        # Display entire file
head file.txt       # First 10 lines
head -n 20 file.txt # First 20 lines
tail file.txt       # Last 10 lines
tail -f file.txt    # Follow file (real-time)
less file.txt       # Page through file
more file.txt       # Page through file

find /path -size +100M             # Find files larger than 100MB
find /path -mtime -7               # Files modified in last 7 days
```

### Search in files
```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt            # Search in file
grep -r "pattern" /path/           # Recursive search
grep -i "pattern" file.txt         # Case-insensitive
grep -n "pattern" file.txt         # Show line numbers

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use `man command` to get detailed help for any command
- Use `command --help` for quick help
- Use `which command` to find where a command is located  
- Use `history | grep keyword` to search your command history
- Use `!!` to repeat the last command
- Use `sudo !!` to repeat the last command with sudo
- Use Tab for auto-completion
- Use `*` and `?` as wildcards in file operations
