This error is caused by **Debian still trying to use the CD-ROM as a package source**, which is invalid in an LXC container and breaks `apt` commands like `apt-get update`.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Remove the CD-ROM Source from `apt`

You need to edit the `sources.list` and comment out or remove the CD-ROM entry.

Run:

```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

You'll see something like this at the top:

```plaintext
deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 12.11.0 _Bookworm_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 with firmware 20250517-09:52] bookworm Release main
```

Either **comment it out** by adding a `#` in front of it:

```plaintext
# deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 12.11.0 _Bookworm_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 with firmware 20250517-09:52] bookworm Release main
```

Or just **delete that line**.

### ‚úÖ Then run:

```bash
apt update
```

Make sure it runs without error, then:

```bash
sh get-docker.sh
```

---

### üß† Optional: Add Official Debian Repos (if missing)

If your sources.list looks empty or broken, here‚Äôs a standard one for **Debian 12 (Bookworm)**:

```bash
cat <<EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
EOF

apt update
```

Then retry installing Docker.
