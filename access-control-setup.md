Great questions! Here‚Äôs how to implement **tight access controls** and **brute-force protection** on your NGINX Proxy Manager (NPM) host:

---

## ‚úÖ Part 1: Enable Access Control Lists (ACLs) in NGINX Proxy Manager

NPM has built-in support for **Access Lists**, which let you:

* Whitelist or blacklist specific IPs
* Restrict access by user (basic auth)
* Block all but certain countries (with GeoIP plugin ‚Äì advanced)

### üîí A. Restrict Access by IP

#### 1. Go to NPM UI ‚Üí Access Lists

* Click **"Access Lists"**
* Click **"Add Access List"**

#### 2. Configure the ACL

* **Name**: e.g., `AllowMyDevices`

* Under **Satisfy Any / All**: choose `All`

* Under **Authorized IP Addresses**, add:

  * Your public IP(s) (check from [https://whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com))
  * Example:

    ```
    123.45.67.89
    192.168.0.0/24   # (if you want to allow local network)
    ```

* Leave the **Users** section empty if you only want IP filtering (optional)

* Save.

#### 3. Apply to Proxy Host

* Go to your **Proxy Host** (e.g., `proxmox.sp3ck.net`)
* Click **Edit**
* Go to the **Access List** dropdown
* Select your new list (`AllowMyDevices`)
* Save

> ‚úÖ Now only the listed IPs can access the proxied service.

### üåç B. Restrict by Country (GeoIP) ‚Äì Advanced

To restrict access by country, you need to **manually edit NGINX configs**, which is not directly supported by the NPM UI out of the box.

Steps:

1. Use a custom Docker image or volume mount with the MaxMind GeoLite2 Country database.
2. Add geo rules to NGINX configs (via advanced custom configs in NPM).

This is quite advanced. If you‚Äôre interested, I can guide you through **GeoIP blocking with MaxMind DB** and a custom `nginx.conf` override.
